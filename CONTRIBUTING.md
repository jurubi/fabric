## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [documentation](README.md).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [issues](https://github.com/nicolasmondain/fabric/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues]([/issues](https://github.com/nicolasmondain/fabric/issues))
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new [issue](https://github.com/nicolasmondain/fabric/issues).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)
